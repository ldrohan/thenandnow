Then And Now allows users to upload/link an old photograph and uses the Google Street View API to capture a current image of that image, creating a photo story or a time juxtaposed memory of that location. Clicking on the Eye on the photo story allows the user to check out enlarged images as well as a google Map centered on the photostory's location. By placing the figure on the map you can take a virtual walking tour of that neighborhood. The Facebook icon will (eventually) allow users to share these stories via their facebook feed.
